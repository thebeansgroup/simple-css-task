# Deliverables:

1. Author module in `app.css`
2. `author-listings.html` should contain the visuals from `Author-listings-page.pdf`
3. `author-page.html` should contain the visuals from `Author-page.pdf`

**N.B. A simple grid has been supplied. There is no need to add any more breakpoints than those used in the grid. **
